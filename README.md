# moltbot-control-ui-custom

A respectful, minimal customization layer for the **Moltbot/Clawdbot Control UI**.

## What
- Adds a right-side **Activity (terminal-like) panel** so long-running runs don't look like a freeze.
- Auto-follow logs; user scroll locks; includes both wall-clock and elapsed timestamps.

## Upstream
This project is based on the upstream Gateway/Control UI work from the Clawd ecosystem (Clawdbot → Moltbot).

- Upstream project: https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot

We keep attribution and aim to keep changes small and upstream-friendly.
